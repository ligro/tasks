### in progress

add dashboard
Still need something to migrate tasks to a dashboard (at least a script, may be something in the interface too) ?

Try to use bootstrap js components.

x migration script
_ admin to check datas (sqlite concurrency issue)
_ rewrite code to use new models

### next

 * make columns stackable horizontally only
 * enhance shorcuts (navigation)
 * review the api (allow to add notes from somewhere else
 * allow to set the prod environment
 * catch api errors to return json with the error
 * migrate to from mongo to sql backend
 * migrate to python3
 * migrate to bootstrap3
 * tag autocompletion
 * task edition/creation inline
 * handle mobile view
 * merge and cache static files (css, js) for production
 * allow to color tags
 * send inscription mail
 * add forgot pwd link
 * do not refresh tasks if the query is empty (on task edition/suppression) just remove from the list
 * add dashboard in URLS anchor

### done

 * allow to save queries, and easily retrieve it
 * alert display (with modals)
 * fix issues when you are disconnected (display a login modal form)
 * handle multiple column view
 * fix the task edition
 * easily filter on tags
 * facetting on tag

 * index the db
 * allow to search in the db
